
 Expression1? expression2: expression3;  
/*In the above syntax, the expression1 is a Boolean condition that can be either true or false value.
If the expression1 results into a true value, then the expression2 will execute.
The expression2 will execute if exp1 is true
If the expression1 returns false value then the expression3 will execute.



As we know that the behavior of conditional operator and 'if-else' is similar but 
they have some differences. Let's look at their differences.

1.A conditional operator is a single programming statement, while the 'if-else' statement is a programming block in which statements come under the parenthesis.
2.A conditional operator can also be used for assigning a value to the variable, whereas
 the 'if-else' statement cannot be used for the assignment purpose.
3.It is not useful for executing the statements when the statements are multiple,
 whereas the 'if-else' statement proves more suitable when executing multiple statements.
4.The nested ternary operator is more complex and cannot be easily debugged, while the 
nested 'if-else' statement is easy to read and maintain.
